# Detailed-Data-Analysis-Project-425
Detailed Analysis of openly available data using information-based, similarity-based, and probability-based machine learning techniques.

The CarSales.csv dataset (Smriti, 2020) contains data on 4346 car sales. 
Using this dataset and various machine learning techniques, three models will be created to predict if a car is expensive or not.

This code imports the dataset, generates summary statistics, generates histograms, preprocesses the data, generates a correlation matrix,
and splits the dataset into testing and training sets. A decision tree is generated and pruned with cost complexity pruning. A KNN model
is generated with an ideal number of neighbors. Finally, a Naive Bayes model is generated using forward sequential feature selection. 
Accuracy metrics, ROC curves, and confusion matrixes are printed for all models.
